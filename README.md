# Mathmatical-3d-shapes

I have added different 3d math shapes produced in Processing.
Main reason was to practice implementing mathmatical formulas to coding to create different shapes.
They maybe needed later in some other codes.
I am still adding new shapes time to time.
By playing with the formulas i might just be found a mathmatical representation of a biological form. But i am not sure to share it at the moment.
